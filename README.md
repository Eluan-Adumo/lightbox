# lightbox
Component for displaying messages and prompts

#THIS IS A REACT SNIPPET!!

After installing this piece of code, call it inside your react component where you want to
display prompts.
To display a prompt, you pass in two props.

#title -> This goes to the header of the prompt as a -- header.
#content -> This goes to the body of the message.

These are the only two configs for now. Other configs coming in later versions.
You may have to go to the css to edit the header background -color:

# download the lightbox.jsx and lightbox.css into the same folder. If you do not, be sure to work your
imports properly.
